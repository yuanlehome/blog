"# Matrix Multiplication from First Principles

matmul deep dive

Matrix multiplication sits at the heart of deep learning. Here is inline math $y = Wx$.

We start from $A \\\\\\in R^{m \\\\\\times k}$ and $B \\\\\\in R^{k \\\\\\times n}$.

$C = AB$

## Vectorized implementation

We often express matrix multiplication as a series of dot products.

\`\`\`python
import torch

C = A @ B
\`\`\`
